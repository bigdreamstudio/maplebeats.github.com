title: What a fucking day
---
This morning,I get up at six.My grandpa is going to dialysis,so I must accompany him.I arrived at the bus station,and waiting for the bus.Half an hour later,my grandpa told us the bus has gone.OMG!I accompanied grandpa many times,never met such a situation.There is no bus anymore,I was forced to give up.And then grandpa told me he can do it himself.Well,I think he is OK,but I am wrong.My aunt change the reservation,and forgot to tell my grandfather.Then grandpa quarrel with doctor,and then the dialysis is not going well.

At noon,I took the bus to the hospital.I called my grandfather,but his phone is power off.About wo hours later,I arrived the hospital.The doctor told me,my grandfather was go back!Oh,what a fucking hospital!The doctor call me to take grandfather to go home,and then let grandfather go back alone!I really have no words.

Never mind,I take a bus to go back.when I arrive the bus sitation.OMG!So many people!20 minutes later,I am on the bus.Actually,the tragedy has just begun.On the bus,my father call me to charge calls in his *Telecom* mobile.I use the taobao app to buy 20RMB *China Mobile* calls,and now I am apply for refund.And then I met a highway traffic jam...Orz

*what a fucking day* !
